What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
   
    He had a second stage come up when you were done killing all of the enemies that was pretty groovy! It had some more powerful enemies which is something I probably wouldn't have thought to add to it. I took a look at his code for a minute and noticed that the boss was added using if statments I think.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

    Definetly the second stage bit. I wish I'd done that with my game. It was clever and fun. Sure one of the sprites looked a tad bit weird, but it wasn't that big of a deal. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    
    Not that this is completely needed for the assignment, but I would probably give the enemies the ability to shoot back and kill the player. I would also give them the ability to move, but again what he accomplished was cool.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

    I mean I feel like the game itself is pretty clear? But maybe I would add a "You Win" screen or something? Then again, I didn't so I don't know if I have the right the judge. The game was pretty self explanatory.


Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

    Yes, I think the bit with the second stage and the boss was actually a tad bit confusing. While I learned from it, I definetly wouldn't say I've mastered the idea of it it.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

    I think? It doesn't have his first and last name, but he still edited it to show his github account, which might be okay?? I'm not totally sure.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

    I don't actually think there was anything in the README.md.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

    I really enjoyed how you added a second stage and a boss- it was really cool and clever!
